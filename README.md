```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User clicks extension icon] --> B[Popup opens]
    B --> C[User clicks 'Extract Events']
    C --> D[Content script extracts events from page]
    D --> E[Background script processes events]
    E --> F[Side panel displays events]

    F --> H[User can export data]
    H --> I[CSV Export]

```

1. The user clicks the extension icon and then the "Extract Events" button in the popup.
2. The content script extracts past event information from the current Meetup.com page.
3. The background script processes this information, opening each event link in a background tab to extract additional details.
